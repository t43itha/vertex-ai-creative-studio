## 7. Documentation Workflows

### Updating Documentation for New Features/Experiments

When new code, features, or experiments are added, it's crucial to update the relevant documentation to ensure discoverability and maintainability.

1.  **Identify Relevant Docs:** Determine which documentation files need updating (e.g., main `README.md`, `experiments/README.md`, `developers_guide.md`).
2.  **Analyze Existing Conventions:** Read the target documentation to understand its structure, tone, and formatting conventions for similar items.
3.  **Synthesize New Content:** Extract key information from the new feature's source code or its own README to create a concise and accurate description.
4.  **Propose Changes:** Present the proposed documentation changes to the user for review and approval before applying them. Use markdown blocks to clearly show the additions or modifications.
5.  **Apply Changes:** Use the `replace` or `write_file` tool to apply the approved changes.
